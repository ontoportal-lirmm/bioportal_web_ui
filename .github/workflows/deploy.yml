# Workflow to deploy OntoPortal UI to stage/prod systems
#
# Required github secrets:
#
# CONFIG_REPO - github repo containing config and customizations for UI. Format 'author/private_config_repo'
# it is used for getting capistrano deployment configuration for stages on the github actions runner and
# PRIVATE_CONFIG_REPO env var is constructed from it which is used by capistrano on the UI hosts for pulling configs.
#
# GH_PAT - github Personal Access Token for accessing private config repo
#
# SSH_JUMPHOST - ssh jump/proxy host though which deployments have to though if UI nodes live on private network.
# SSH_JUMPHOST_USER - username  to use to connect to the ssh jump/proxy.
#
# DEPLOY_ENC_KEY - key for decrypting deploymnet ssh key residing in config/
# this SSH key is used for accessing jump host, UI nodes, and private github repo.
